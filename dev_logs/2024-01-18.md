## Goal
## Sequence System
- event is message with sequenceId
- Based on the application of event sequence in tradingService and the design of Event, implement sequence system.
    - SequenceService: get message, use sequenceHandler, export sequenced message(event)
    - SequenceHandler: sequence the message, generate event, and store them into db
    - EventEntity, UniqueEventEntity and their repository: for persistence.
- Unit Test SequenceHandler
## Completed Work
- All above
## Next Step
- Integration Test the rest of tradingEngineService: the redis, kafka function, persistence.
- Integration Test for SequenceService
- Design API system to receive traders' request and send response.
## Other Notes
- Why sequence: track event, prevent duplicate event, out of order event and missing event.
- data flow: kafka consumer->message->sequence system->event(store in db)->trading engine
- SequenceService: currently only set 1 consumer, I would not suggest adding more consumers or even using consumer group, the difference in processing message would break the original sequence.
