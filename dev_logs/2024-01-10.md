## Goal
### For trading engine
- Implement a memory based matching service and its related classes


## Completed Work
- Implement OrderBook, its related classes and its Java Bean
- Implement a memory based matching service based on OrderBook.
- Test the above.

## Next Step
- Implement a memory based clearing service and its related classes.


## Other Notes
- How we order the matching priority: price and time:
  - There are 2 order book, one for ask and one for bid, sorted by priority
  - Bid price higher, priority higher, ask price lower, priority higher.
  - If price is the same, then the order which comes first has higher priority.
- We use the above matching priority to sort the OrderBook.
- OrderBook is generated from the orderEntity:
  - OrderBookItem is a item in OrderBook, each represents a price and volume.
  - volume is the sum of quantity of all orders with the same price.
  - In other words, each OrderBookItem represents a price level, which is the orders with the same price.
