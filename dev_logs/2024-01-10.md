## Completed Work


## Next Step
- Implement a memory based matching service and its related classes.


## Other Notes
- How we order the matching priority: price and time:
- - There are 2 order book, one for ask and one for bid, sorted by priority
- - Bid price higher, priority higher, ask price lower, priority higher.
- - If price is the same, then the order which comes first has higher priority.
