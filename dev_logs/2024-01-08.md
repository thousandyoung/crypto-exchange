## Completed Work
- 
- Implement the configuration of spring cloud, add config for every springboot project
- Implement the configuration of the database, involving docker, mysql, jpa, springboot...
- Implement a memory based order service and its database entity

## Next Step
- Implement a memory based matching service and its related classes.


## Other Notes
- Data flow: Entity->Repository->Service->Controller
- As for 'memory based', I mean it is run in memory but of course it needs persistence in case of recovering, which will be done by a specific thread later in order to do batch operations.
