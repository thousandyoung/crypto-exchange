## Goal
### For whole system
  - Use Kafka to process event, implement message and messaging related class, and its configuration.
  - Use Redis to process result, implement redis related classes, config

## Completed Work
- Kafka: implemented config,  basic function and classes
- Redis: implemented config,  basic function and classes

## Next Step
### For trading engine
- After processing orders, use asynchronous database insertion to persist them, Need to implement storage related class and service.
- Pack up asset, order, matching, clearing, event input, redis output, altogether, implementing TradingEngineService.
- Implement a recovering system in case of memory crash.
  - Define the state of trading engine:
    - asset list
    - order list
    - matching list
    - currently processing event (sequenceID)
- Test the above

## Other Notes
- Kafka : producer -> topic -> consumer.
  - topic has partitions, which can be placed on different machines to increase volume.
  - consumer can form groups, the messages sent to a group will be shared equally by its members(consumers).
- Redis's pub/sub idea is very similar to Kafka's  producer -> topic -> consumer.
